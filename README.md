# DS-4002-CS3

## Overview  
This repository contains all necessary materials for completing the Fruit Freshness Classification Case Study. It includes the data, deliverables, and reference materials required to understand, analyze, and develop a machine learning solution for classifying fruit images as either "fresh" or "spoiled."  

---

## Important Documents  
- **Fruit Freshness Hook.pdf**  
  Provides an engaging introduction to the case study and explains its significance in reducing food waste and preventing foodborne illnesses.  
- **Fruit Freshness Rubric.pdf**  
  Outlines the requirements, evaluation criteria, and tips for success. Use this document as a guide throughout the project to meet all deliverables effectively.  

---

## Data  
The necessary data is located in the **DATA/** folder. It includes pre-categorized images of fruits in subfolders for "fresh" and "spoiled" across various fruit types. The dataset was obtained from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bdd69gyhv8/1).  

---

## Reference Materials  
- **Foodborne Pathogens Article.pdf**  
  Background reading material highlighting the significance of identifying spoiled fruits in preventing foodborne illnesses.  

---

## Deliverables  
- **OUTPUT/** folder contains analysis results and visualizations generated during the project, such as:  
  - `classified_images_grid_key.png`  
  - `fresh_vs_spoiled_confusion_matrix.png`  
  - `training_validation_accuracy.png`  

Ensure all deliverables align with the guidelines provided in the rubric.
